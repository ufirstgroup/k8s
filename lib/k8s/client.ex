defmodule K8s.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  An experimental k8s client.

  Functions return `K8s.Operation`s that represent kubernetes operations.

  To run operations pass them to: `run/2`, `run/3`, or `run/4`.

  When specifying kinds the format should either be in the literal kubernetes kind name (eg `"ServiceAccount"`)
  or the downcased version seen in kubectl (eg `"serviceaccount"`). A string or atom may be used.

  ## Examples
  ```elixir
  "Deployment", "deployment", :Deployment, :deployment
  "ServiceAccount", "serviceaccount", :ServiceAccount, :serviceaccount
  "HorizontalPodAutoscaler", "horizontalpodautoscaler", :HorizontalPodAutoscaler, :horizontalpodautoscaler
  ```

  `opts` to `K8s.Client.Runner` modules are HTTPoison HTTP option overrides.
